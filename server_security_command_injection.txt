Sever Development Security -- Shell Command Injection

If the server needs to take inputs from the front-end (e.g. Web UI, REST API ...), then these inputs should not become the arguements of a shell command directly without any check.
e.g. 
If the server side receives data as below from a web UI:
userdata;ls -l;pwd
Then, the server may call a shell API(e.g. python API or Go API) to handle the data, e.g. echo the data
echo userdata;ls -l;pwd
Then it will run the commands below one by one:
- echo userdata
- ls -l
- pwd
