<h1>Access the ESun VPC Edge EC2 Instance</h1>
  <p>
  After a new ESun VPC Edge is launched, <b>http://public_ip_of_ec2_instance</b> can access the configuration page. 
  <b>http://public_ip_of_ec2_instance/login</b> is for the admin to login. The default username and password to login the VM is:
 </p>
  <p> username: admin </p>
  <p> password: admin123 </p>
  


<h1>Security Awareness of the Web Login</h1>
  
<p> 
  The VPC Edge Access Point V1.0.0 has the Web Login to administrate the server, and it has the SMTP server settings to send the e-mail.
</p>
<p> <b>Important: </b> </p>
<p> <b>1. Please change the default password of the web portal after the 1st time login. The default username/password is admin/admin123 .</b></p>
<p> <b>2. Please set the "Email for Forgot Password" to get the password back if the password is forgotten. </b></p>
<p>
Please set "SMTP to Send Email" to a well known SMTP server(e.g. your comapny email server), 
  or the email sent out may go the spam folder of the email receiver.
</p>
<p>
The password of the Web Login is hashed before it is saved into the server database. 
  That means the server doesn't store the plain text of the Web portal password.
</p>
<p>
The password to login the SMTP server is encrypted before it is saved into the server database. 
  The keys to encrypt passwords are unique in different servers. 
  The VPC Edge server doesn't have the plain text password of the SMTP password in the database. 
  However, if someone finds the ecyrption key in the server, 
  and knows the algorithm how to encrypt and decrypt the password, then the password can be turned into the plain text.
