<h1>Access the ESun VPC Edge EC2 Instance with <b>HTTP</b></h1>
  <p>
  After a new ESun VPC Edge is launched, <b>http://public_ip_of_ec2_instance</b> can access the configuration page. 
  <b>http://public_ip_of_ec2_instance/login</b> is for the admin to login. The default username and password to login a new instance:
 </p>
  <p> username: admin </p>
  <p> password: admin123 </p>
  
<h1>Access the ESun VPC Edge EC2 Instance with <b>HTTPS</b></h1>
<p> 
  <b>HTTPS </b> is recommended to access the EC2 instance. And it is required by Okta/SAML Single Sign On(SSO).
  To make HTTPS work, it needs to upload the certs. 
  The <b>"Settings" </b> section has the "Upload Certs for Web Service" to upload the certs. 
 </p>
 <p> <b> IMPORTANT: Once the certs are applied, then the http will be closed. And it requires to to re-type the URL to broswer: </b></p>
 <p> <b>https:</b>//public_ip_of_ec2_instance/login </p>
  

<h1>Best Security Pratice of Web Login</h1>
  
<p> 
  The ESun VPC Edge has the Web Login to administrate the server, and it has the SMTP server settings to send the e-mail.
</p>
<p> <b>Important: </b> </p>
<p> <b>1. Please change the default password of the web portal after the 1st time login. The default username/password is admin/admin123 .</b></p>
<p> <b>2. Please set the "Email for Forgot Password" to get the password back if the password is forgotten. </b></p>
<p>
If it doesn't configure an email SMTP server, it will use a local default email server, which will show the "From" <b>no-reply@voipeye.com</b> 
 in the receiver's e-mail box .
But, please set "SMTP to Send Email" to a well known SMTP server(e.g. your comapny email server, or gmail), 
  or the email to the endpoint users or admin may go the spam folder of the email receivers. If it is <b>gmail</b>, 
 then password is the <b>App password</b>, not the gmail login password.
</p>
<p>
The password of the Web Login is hashed before it is saved into the server database. 
  That means the server doesn't store the plain text of the Web portal password. 
</p>
<p>
The password to login the SMTP server is encrypted before it is stored into the server database. 
The keys to encrypt passwords are unique for each new launched ec2 instance.
