<h3>Configure MacOS IPSec Remote User VPN</h3>
  <p> System Settings --> VPN --> Add VPN Configuration --> IKEV2</p>
<p>
  Display Name: Any
</p>
<p> Server address: Server IP or domain name</p>
<p> Remote ID: Must be domain name if domain name is configured. Or it is the server IP address</p>  
<p> Local ID: User name</p>
<p> Type: None</p>
<p> Select: Shared Secret</p>  
<p> Shared Secret: The password</p>  
If it is a SAML user, then the password is the token generated from "Generate New Token for VPN Auth". 
  The SAML token is a temp password, which will expire in 2 hours. If the token is less than 2 hours 
  and the same OKTA or SAML account has another login, then the last token will be replaced with new generated token. 
  That means it needs to refill "Shared Secret" after 2 hours or after another OKTA/SAML login. 
<p> The existing VPN connection will not be disconnected until next VPN reconnection even if the token has been expired.</p>
