The <b>"Configure Endpoint Routes" </b>menu is to configure client traffic to pass through the remote VPN server.
</p>
<p>For example, the configuration below is to pass all traffic to the remote VPN server, and it routes any traffic, which tries to reach the private CIDR 
  "172.16.0.0/16,172.31.0.0/16" in the cloud side, to the remote VPN server too.
<b>CIDR or IP to pass through server(must e.g.: 10.10.1.0/24,172.16.1.1)<b>:
