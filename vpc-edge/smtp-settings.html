<h1>Add SMTP Server to Send Email</h1>

  For example, send one-time temporary password to one e-mail address if the IT admin forgets his web login password.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Server: </b> SMTP server URL or IP address, e.g. smtp.gmail.com or the company's SMTP URL
</p>
<p>  
  <b>Port: </b> By default, 22 is for plain connection, 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL
</p>
<p>  
  <b>Email: </b> The sender e-mail, which will be seen in one e-mail as the "From".
</p>  
<p>  
  <b>Password: </b> Normally, it is the password that login the e-mail account. But Gmail needs to create the App password for it.
</p>
<p>  
  <b>Enable TLS: </b> TLS connection to transmit the e-mail. e.g. If it enables for Gmail, then the Port will use 587.
</p>  
<p>  
  <b>Enable SSL: </b> SSL connection to transmit the e-mail, e.g. If it enables for Gmail, then the Port will use 465.
